# Export Insights #

Make a backup of all your insights to your NAS or other WebDAV compliant storage.
The insights are zipped and stored in .csv format so you can open them in excel
and create all kinds of statistics and charts.

Backups can be easily scheduled by using the trigger card in a flow. You can
schedule a full backup, or a backup per app.

Note: making a backup can take a long time (more than 10 minutes), depending on
how many insights you have. It is not possible to restore a backup into Homey.
